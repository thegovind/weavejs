# Weave.js
<!-- Generated by illuminate -->

> Weave.js is an open-source TypeScript framework for building real-time collaborative whiteboard and canvas applications on HTML5 Canvas. It provides a headless SDK with CRDT-based state synchronization (Yjs), canvas rendering (Konva.js), a custom React Reconciler, and pluggable store backends (WebSocket, Azure Web PubSub, Standalone). Built by InditexTech and production-proven at Inditex.

Weave.js is a monorepo with 8 packages: the core SDK (@inditextech/weave-sdk), React bindings (@inditextech/weave-react), type definitions (@inditextech/weave-types), three store implementations (WebSocket, Azure Web PubSub, Standalone), and two CLI scaffolding tools (create-weave-frontend-app, create-weave-backend-app).

The SDK uses a manager-pattern architecture where the central Weave class delegates to ~18 specialized managers for state, rendering, stores, nodes, plugins, actions, users, mutex locks, exports, and more. State is synchronized via Yjs CRDTs through SyncedStore, and rendering is handled by Konva.js via a custom React Reconciler. The framework requires Node.js 22.11+ and React 18.
